# Zephyr_ECG_Summary_Glucose data processing

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive suite for extracting ECG morphology, RR, and statistical features from Zephyr devices. It is structured in a series of steps, each encapsulated in individual Python scripts, to provide a modular and easy-to-understand approach to creating datasets to feed to DL networks. The repository contains code for the TAMU-Sense Project. Contains code from reading the ECG-Sumamry file from the Zephyr folder and then processing it with the reading glucose file. The code contains all necessary functions, from reading to creating a dataset before feeding it to CNN and RNN networks.

##Repository Structure

### `Python Env Setup`
Three env YAML files are provided under the preprocess folder. You can pick any one file. you can create a new conda env using the following line in the terminal:
`conda env create --name envname --file=environments.yml`
These envs will help towards development. Please take care of the following important libraries:
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Neurokit 2
4) Tensorflow with GPU capabilities

### `Preprocessing data`
Zephyr BioHarness provides the following files: 
1) record_timestamp_ECG.csv
2) record_timestamp_SummaryEnhanced.csv

You should also have one glucose file. Ensure the glucose file contains no missing values and only numerical values in the glucose column. you can use preprocessing/helper_glucose.py

Run the file preprocessing/ECG_read_and_combine.py -> This reads all ECG.csv files and combines them in one single pickle file.


### `Step1_create_beats.py`
- **Description**: The ECG.pkl (combined all ecg files), summary.pkl (combined all summary files) and glucose.pkl file. The Python file creates separate beats from all the input files. it checks for HRConfidence, and ECGnoise and also develops variable length beats. This will generate a hypo_label that corresponds to the hypo vs normal glucose classification problem

- **Key Functions**: 

### `step1_create_beats_hyper.py`
- **Description**: The ECG.pkl (combined all ecg files), summary.pkl (combined all summary files) and glucose.pkl file. The Python file creates separate beats from all the input files. it checks for HRConfidence, and ECGnoise and also develops variable length beats. This will generate a hyper_label that corresponds to the hyper vs normal glucose classification problem


### `step2_PCA_mahlanobis_filtering.py`
- **Description**: [Details of PCA and Mahalanobis filtering, e.g., "Applies PCA for dimensionality reduction and Mahalanobis distance for anomaly detection."]
- **Usage**: `python step2_PCA_mahlanobis_filtering.py [arguments]`

- **Description**: [Integration of PCA and PAD in beat creation, e.g., "Combines PCA with PAD for optimized beat creation."]
- **Usage**: `python step3_PCA_PAD_beats_creation.py [arguments]`

### `step4_Model_CNN.py`
